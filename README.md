# Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Analysis and Prediction

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present
in women in small amounts. The name polycystic ovary syndrome describes the numerous small cysts that form in the ovaries. However, some women with the 
disorder do not have cysts, while some women without the disorder do develop cysts.
Here, we will analyze data to understand which are possible influencers of PCOS. The dataset includes several variables, which are suspected to influence
the chances of Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
